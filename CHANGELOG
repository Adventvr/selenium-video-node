Version 0.4 21/04/2014
======================

* Commit some pre-built linux binaries to Git.
* Make Maven assemble the native code zip file.
* Added support for Windows x86_64 - committed some binaries for it (details on wiki). Note that this requires a 64 bit JVM to work.

Version 0.3 18/04/2014
======================

* Move the compiled MKV encoder code out into its own library, where it should be.
* Fix C memory leak by actually freeing up memory.


Version 0.2 15/04/2014
======================

Convert project to use a WebM/VP8 encoder - we now use JNA to run the encoder, with a C implementation to abstract away the complicated C data structures.

 * Higher framerates achieved
 * Capped framerate at 8 fps, slightly slower than the maximum speed, due to continuing time-base issues
 * Implementation now restricted to Linux-only.


Version 0.1 08/04/2014n
======================

Initial implementation. Used a Java implementation of an h264 encoder. It centralized videos on the Hub using some download servlets, and allowed the user to get the video.

 * The encoder wasn't very fast (~4 fps, with the Java Robot taking screenshots)
 * The videos generated were massive
 * Some time-base issues
 * Some browsers/players refused to play back the video
 * Patent issues for encoding h264
